### Polymerase fidelity project

![Polyfid analysis](https://github.com/mikessh/polyfid/blob/master/splash.png)

This repository contains data for our polymerase error quantification protocol. This protocol relies on unique molecular identifier (UMI) technique and a sampling bottleneck to ensure elimination library prep and sequencing errors while retaining original PCR error profile. Initial data analysis is performed using [MAGERI](https://github.com/mikessh/mageri) software, see ``mageri/`` folder in this repository for an example configuration file and MAGERI repository for raw data analysis guidelines.

All figures reported in our study can be generated by compiling an R markdown template ``polyfid.Rmd``. Pre-requisites for running the analysis are:

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)

The resulting PDF can be found [here](https://github.com/mikessh/polyfid/blob/master/polyfid.pdf).

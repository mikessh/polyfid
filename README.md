### Polymerase fidelity project

This repository contains data for our polymerase error quantification protocol. This protocol relies on unique molecular identifier (UMI) technique and a sampling bottleneck to ensure elimination library preparation and sequencing errors while retaining original PCR error profile. Initial data analysis is performed using [MAGERI](https://github.com/mikessh/mageri) software, see ``processing/`` folder in this repository for configuration files and shell script.

All figures reported in our study can be generated by compiling an R markdown template ``polyfid.Rmd``, the template can be viewed and compiled using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

The resulting PDF can be found [here](https://github.com/mikessh/polyfid/blob/master/polyfid.pdf).
